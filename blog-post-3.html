            <h2>Best Practices in Code Review</h2>
            <p style="color: #666; font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Posted on October 2024</p>

            <p>Code review is a critical part of maintaining code quality and team knowledge sharing. However, many teams struggle with implementing effective code review processes. In this post, I'll share best practices that have worked well in my experience.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">First and foremost, establish clear guidelines for what should be reviewed. This includes code style, architecture patterns, security considerations, and test coverage requirements. When expectations are clear, reviews become more constructive and less subjective.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Keep pull requests focused and reasonably sized. Large pull requests are harder to review thoroughly and increase the likelihood of issues being missed. Aim for pull requests that can be reviewed in 15-30 minutes. If a feature requires a larger change, consider breaking it into smaller, logical chunks.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Reviews should be about the code, not the person. Use language that focuses on the work: "This function could be simplified by..." rather than "You did this wrong." Foster a culture where feedback is seen as a gift that helps everyone improve.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Automated tools can handle style and basic quality checks, freeing reviewers to focus on logic, architecture, and design patterns. Tools like linters, formatters, and static analysis should run before code review even begins.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Finally, set reasonable timelines for reviews. Code sitting in review for days slows down development. Aim to review pull requests within 24 hours, and prioritize unblocking teammates.</p>
